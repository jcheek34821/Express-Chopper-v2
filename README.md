# Express-Chopper-v2

This script was created for baseball video purposes to use video that has been previously chopped in order to group hitters into a single video simultaneously 
in one session. The script uses user input after each recording has finished (second spacebar press) and prompts the user to tag said player using 1 of 10 reserved
single digit numbers from 0-9. Once a number has been designated the video will begin playing again and ready to record. Below are the key bindings for this script.

Pause							=	p<br>
Unpause						=	1 + p<br>
Remove last set of frames (recording mode) 	=	r<br>
Continue recording (accidental 2nd spacebar)	=	r<br>
Fast forward						=	‘Ctrl’ (toggle on)<br>
Normal speed						=	‘Ctrl’ (toggle off)<br>
Rewind						=	Left Arrow Key<br>
Jump 30 seconds					=	Right Arrow Key<br>
Save video (pauses)					=	s<br>
Record	 (toggle on)					=	Spacebar<br>
Stop Recording (toggle on)				=	Spacebar<br>
